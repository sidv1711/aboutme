# 👋 Hi, I'm Sid

I'm a dual-degree student in the UC Berkeley MET program studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science + Business. I'm passionate about building tools at the intersection of AI, systems, and user experience — especially ones that solve real problems, run efficiently, and scale with purpose.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On Now

- 🔬 **Revyl (YC W24)**: Interning at a Y Combinator-backed startup where I built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to orchestrate mobile E2E tests, reduced p95 latency by 40%, and deployed a Slackbot for real-time observability data retrieval.
- 🗣 **CodeVox**: A mobile voice-first coding assistant using Whisper + Claude Code that generates patches from spoken commands; scaled to 150+ devs in 3 months.
- 🧠 **LDT Compliance Copilot**: An AI agent that uses NVIDIA NeMo + LangChain to parse FDA/CLIA regulations and generate compliance gap reports in seconds.

## 🛠 Recent Projects

- 🍽 **NutriGenie**: Built an AI meal-planning agent that aligns macros, budgets, and fitness goals using grocery store APIs and OpenAI — scaled to 300+ users in 2 months.
- 📚 **AmigoAI**: Created an adaptive SAT practice-test module and improved tutoring accuracy by 18% using retrieval-augmented generation.
- 💪 **Uberlast**: Co-founded a personalized fitness app with pose estimation and progressive overload tracking — reached 25%+ 30-day retention.
- 🔔 **Revyl Slackbot**: Built and deployed an NLP-to-SQL Slackbot to surface live service diagnostics, replacing a Grafana workflow and cutting triage cycles.
